A106ZCP7RSXMRU,19034,1,5,"We like the regular Little Bear cheese puffs so we tried the crunchy too. Excellent! Very satisfying crunch, yummy natural cheese taste, and nothing to feel bad about healthwise (unlike those awful fluorescent cheese-colored snacks popular in the grocery store!). This brand is excellent, we highly recommend all Little Bear foods!",331,40,POSITIVE,0.9998243451118469
A106ZCP7RSXMRU,62479,1,4,"Gorilla Munch tastes a lot like Cap'n Crunch, just not as sugary sweet and no chemical aftertaste. It's a good alternative to the unhealthy store brands if your kids are not into granola and only want the sweet cereals. Not our favorite of the Envirokids - we love the Panda Puffs - but if you are looking to replace Captain Crunch, Kix or similar cereal, this is a good choice.",378,40,POSITIVE,0.997501790523529

A106ZCP7RSXMRU,151847,3,3,"We tried McCanns oatmeal about a year ago, ordering the variety pack. It was delicious and healthy. So I decided to order one of the favorite flavors, Maple & Brown Sugar. It was still delicious and healthy, but I don't remember having so many ""hulls"" in the oatmeal. I'm assuming these little hard bits are part of the outer layer of the oat, harmless but not really edible. My daughter won't eat it now because of it, so I'm stuck with too much oatmeal. At least it keeps well, but I'd hesitate to order again.",512,40,NEGATIVE,0.9441130757331848

A106ZCP7RSXMRU,159008,2,5,"This is our favorite brand of popcorn. They do not use hydrogenated oil, MSG, or aspartame in any of their flavors. Most of the kernals pop and it tastes fresh with no aftertaste. We enjoy the Butter Lovers and the Butter Kettle the most. The 28-ct box is a great value if you enjoy popcorn a lot. I buy this exact box at my local Sams for less than seven bucks though. Perhaps Amazon will carry it comparably.",410,40,POSITIVE,0.9989420771598816

A281NPSIMI1C2R,178955,1,5,"Bigelow's Mint Medley is a soothing herbal tea. It contains peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel and hibiscus. Peppermint is the dominant flavor and it makes the tea especially aromatic. I find this tea delicious with honey. It clears the head and helps to refocus the mind. It causes you to relax and take a deep breath. Therefore I find this tea good for stress relief. Each sip is really soul cleansing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",459,38,POSITIVE,0.9997015595436096
A281NPSIMI1C2R,206149,1,3,"I was looking for something my husband could eat after mouth surgery and I bought this thinking it would be sweet and delicious. It is much more like a dark chocolate pudding than a sweet fudge. I would not personally buy it again even though I like dark chocolate. Maybe if you added some sugar to it that would improve it. It isn't bitter, just it isn't very sweet. I'd suggest you buy one box at the store before you order 24!

A281NPSIMI1C2R,206220,12,5,This tea has just the slightest hints of orange zest and a little spice. It reminds me of when I used to go to Seattle to my grandmother's house and we would have tea and her famous apple pie. A relaxing tea you can drink with honey or with milk and sugar.

This tea is flavored with real fruit juice concentrate and is made mostly with apples, hibiscus, blackberry leaves, orange peel and licorice root. Now I can't really taste the licorice it is far too subtle. This is just slightly tart and has a lovely deep burgudy color. Not a tea I crave but something different.
